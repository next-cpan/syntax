NAME
    syntax - Activate syntax extensions

VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        # either
        use syntax 'foo';

        # or
        use syntax foo => { ... };

        # or
        use syntax qw( foo bar ), baz => { ... };

DESCRIPTION
    This module activates community provided syntax extensions to Perl. You
    pass it a feature name, and optionally a scalar with arguments, and the
    dispatching system will load and install the extension in your package.

    The import arguments are parsed with Data::OptList. There are no
    standardised options. Please consult the documentation for the specific
    syntax feature to find out about possible configuration options.

    The passed in feature names are simply transformed: "function" becomes
    Syntax::Feature::Function and "foo_bar" would become
    "Syntax::Feature::FooBar".

METHODS
  import
        syntax->import( @spec );

    This method will dispatch the syntax extension setup to the specified
    feature handlers for the calling package.

  import_into
        syntax->import_into( $into, @spec );

    Same as "import", but performs the setup in $into instead of the calling
    package.

  unimport
        syntax->unimport( @features );

    This method will trigger uninstallations of the @features from the
    calling package.

  unimport_from
        syntax->unimport_from( $from, @features );

    Same as "unimport", but will uninstall the @features from $from.

RECOMMENDED FEATURES
    *   Syntax::Feature::Function

        Activates functions with parameter signatures.

SEE ALSO
    Syntax::Feature::Function, Devel::Declare
